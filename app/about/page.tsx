    bio: "Heidi entered the world of rescue as a volunteer for a PA based group, and spent several years building a foster network on Long Island. Her own first foster was a dog she pulled in mid-winter from a shelter in upstate New York. The mussed and matted YorkiePoo smelled so badly that, to keep from gagging, Heidi wrapped her in several towels and drove home with the windows open. A thorough cleaning revealed a very beautiful and very sweet little girl named Leah. After her swift adoption, Heidi's home became â€“ and remains -- a revolving door for foster dogs (usually several at one time)..."

Given our many years in rescue, we've come to realize that saving every needy dog is impossible, but we remain forever grateful for the ones we do save.

                    Charlotte, our Ambassadog, is the sweetest of Yorkies. We can't thank Dori and her staff at Save-A-Pet enough for bringing her into our lives. Found as a stray at a construction site in Queens, NY, with a damaged and dangling front leg, it was promptly amputated. And yet, she doesn't miss it at all, keeping up with the rest of the pack with sassiness, spirit and spunk.

                    She absolutely adores people and thrives, in true doggy diva fashion, on being the center of attention. We at Yorkie911 Rescue couldn't have asked for a better representative to highlight who we are and what we do.
